## Number-Charades

It is a simple logical game in which you have to guess the number and computer will match it with its own random number and tell you that number is bigger or smaller. 

If you guess correctly then you win yay ðŸ¥³. 

If you guess slightly close to it, reflects the same ðŸ¤—...

And if you don't guess the correct number before the limit exceeds, you will lose ðŸ˜¨...

Start playing during your free time and enjoy it's simplicity...
